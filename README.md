# NetBitz3
## NetBitz3 - A really simple packer for .NET applications

Why NetBitz?
- NetBitz can scramble the outside appearance of your application while the actual application remains the same
- It provides basic protection against static analysis by encrypting the binary and decrypting it at runtime
- It is extremely simple, just build and run `NetBitzPack.exe <your_application_to_pack.exe>`
